# Hello, I'm Grady.

## I do programming as a hobby, and I am aiming for a job in the field.

 - I am a high school student, with plans of getting a bachelors in Computer Science.
 - I'm currently learning Python, and I have knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
 - My cat's name is Miso. She's pretty cool.
 - I quite enjoy 3D modelling, specifically in Blender. I am still learning, though. I plan to also learn other software.
